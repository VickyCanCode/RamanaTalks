# Product Context: Ramana Maharshi Talks

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Spiritual seekers worldwide face several challenges when trying to access authentic spiritual guidance:

1. **Limited Access to Authentic Teachers**: Genuine spiritual teachers are rare and often geographically inaccessible
2. **Inconsistent Information**: Online spiritual content varies widely in authenticity and quality
3. **Language Barriers**: Many seekers cannot access teachings in their native language
4. **Time Constraints**: Traditional spiritual guidance requires specific timing and availability
5. **Lack of Personalization**: Generic spiritual content doesn't address individual questions and contexts
6. **Information Overload**: Too much conflicting spiritual information available online

### The Solution
Ramana Maharshi Talks provides a digital platform that:
- Offers 24/7 access to authentic spiritual guidance based on Ramana's teachings
- Uses AI to provide personalized, contextually relevant responses
- Maintains the authentic voice and wisdom of Sri Ramana Maharshi
- Supports multiple languages for global accessibility
- Provides a focused, distraction-free environment for spiritual inquiry
